            <h1>State Department</h1>
            <p>In India, the term "Department of State" is not commonly used to refer to government agencies. Instead,
                the Indian government is organized into various ministries and departments that oversee different
                aspects of governance. These ministries and departments are responsible for formulating policies,
                implementing government programs, and managing specific sectors or areas of administration</p>
